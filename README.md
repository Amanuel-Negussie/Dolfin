## Executive Summary
**Problem**: Canadians face significant challenges in managing their personal finances due to fragmented insights provided by individual banks. On average, Canadians have 2-3 bank accounts, making it difficult to get a comprehensive view of their spending habits and financial health. Logging in and out of multiple accounts and dealing with different user interfaces leads to inefficiency and increased learning costs.

**Solution**: Dolfin offers a unified platform that connects all your bank accounts, providing real-time information on spending habits, recurring subscriptions, net worth, and budget management. With Mint (owned by Intuit) shutting down, Dolfin steps in as the defacto Canadian solution, catering specifically to Canadians with low-cost freemium and premium options, SOC2 compliance, and a focus on user feedback-driven feature development.

**Primary Features and Benefits**:
- **Net Worth Tracking**: View your assets and liabilities, and track data trends daily, weekly, and monthly.
- **Bank Integration**: Connect and manage multiple bank accounts seamlessly.
- **Budget Creation**: Create and manage a comprehensive budget.
- **Manual Asset Addition**: Add personal assets such as cars, houses, and gifted possessions to measure your net worth accurately.
- **Recurring Subscription Tracking**: Automatically track recurring subscriptions for better financial management.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplified and consistent user experience across all features.
